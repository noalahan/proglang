I incorporated elements from the following sources into my assignment submission.

* Used Pattern Guard outlines from lecture 9 to create pattern guards throughout the assignment
* Used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11569650/what-is-the-difference-between-and-in-haskell to understand stack test error message: `Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’
                  with actual type ‘[Integer]’`
